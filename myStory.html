        wow! what if i told you that i met Peter Obi. I was at the airport i had
        already boarded <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        i was sitting down about to doze off and then Peter Obi's hand touched
        my shoulder <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        i didnt know who he was but then when i found out i was in true awe that
        one of the most famous people in the world just touched my shoulder.
      </p>
      <h3>how i almost got in trouble</h3>
      <p>
        there was a boy lets call this boy idris,idris was a very interesting
        guy he was known for his anger issues all around the school<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        maybe not all around the school,but in our set. Idris is a boarder and
        unluckily for me i was also a boarder<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        a lot of people get in trouble due to idris's anger issues,everyone in
        my flat has gotten in trouble because of him <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        we thought telling him would have made a difference but we were
        completely wrong.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        he lashed out and started fighting but he forgets that we had people
        that are bigger than him<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        he tried to fight them but lost and he promised never to fight again
